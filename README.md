# Vite React TypeScript App

This is a basic template for a React application built with Vite and TypeScript please make follow the attached test instructions.

## Features

- Fast and optimized development environment with Vite
- React for building user interfaces
- TypeScript for static typing and enhanced developer experience

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v6 or later) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (v1 or later)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://APPLUSLABCENTRALPRO@dev.azure.com/APPLUSLABCENTRALPRO/HR.TechnicalTests/_git/ApplusLaboratories.HR.TechnicalTests.Frontend.React
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd ApplusLaboratories.HR.TechnicalTests.Frontend.React
   ```

3. Install the dependencies using npm or Yarn:

   ```shell
   # With npm
   npm install

   # With Yarn
   yarn
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```shell
   # With npm
   npm run dev

   # With Yarn
   yarn dev
   ```

   This will start the development server at `http://localhost:3000`. Open this URL in your browser to view the application.

5. Start building your React application by modifying the code in the `src` directory. The changes will be hot-reloaded in the browser as you save the files.

```shell
# With npm
npm run build
